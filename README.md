# End-to-End-SQL-Project-Pizza-Shop
Detailed review of a personal MySQL end-to-end project.

Overview
This repository documents the process of building a comprehensive database for a Pizza Shop portfolio project. The goal was to create an efficient and well-organized database structure to facilitate various analyses and visualizations. The project involved pre-generating tables from Excel files, normalizing the data, defining relationships, and creating MySQL queries for specific business questions. The resulting database was then visualized using Power BI.
